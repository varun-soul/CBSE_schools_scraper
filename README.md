# CBSE School Data Scraper:

This scraper goes through the following cbse website on Chrome: https://saras.cbse.gov.in/cbse_aff/schdir_Report/userview.aspx

It iterates through the list of states and then for each state, it visits the specific school's information table (which contains more detailed information about the school than present in the list of schools you normally get) and collects data from there.

This is my first proper python project so I am not sure what mistakes I have made or how the code could be made to run faster. It takes about 4 hours on my machine to scrape through all the 30k CBSE schools. 

Please feel free to suggest any improvements :3
